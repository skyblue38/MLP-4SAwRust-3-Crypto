# MLP-4SAwRust-3Crypto [Public Key Cryptography](https://liveproject.manning.com/project/1554)
In this project the RSA encryption system will be implemented (albeit without using really big numbers). The RSA encryption scheme depends on several features of prime numbers, so the milestones use them. Work with prime numbers will involve some basic number theory and modular arithmetic.

This project is divided into six milestones. Click on the links below to read about each one...

### [1. GCD and LCM](1-GDM-LCM.md)
### [2. Fast Exponentiation](2-Fast-Exponent.md)
### [3. Sieve of Eratosthenes](3-Sieve.md)
### [4. Factoring Numbers](4-Factoring.md)
### [5. Primality Testing](5-Primality.md)
### [6. RSA](6-RSA.md)
